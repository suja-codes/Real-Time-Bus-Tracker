### Description 

- A real time bus tracker for MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) route 1 Harvard Square - Nubian Station.

- This project uses mapbox, an open-source platform that allows us to create and display maps on a web page. 
  
- The mapboxgl JavaScript library helps add customizations to map with controls for fullscreen access, zoom and rotation.

- Data from MBTA route 1 is pulled from MBTA via APIs.

- Popups provide bus id and seat availability and can be closed if needed.

### To Run this Program

In order to run this file, Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a browser.


### Future RoadMap 

- This project can be still be enhanced by adding directionality of the bus.

- In the near future, I am planning on creating a real time train map for my zipcode.
